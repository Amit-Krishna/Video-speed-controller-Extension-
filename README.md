# Video Speed Controller - Chrome Extension

A powerful, feature-rich browser extension that allows you to control the playback speed of any HTML5 video on any website. This project was built from the ground up and includes an on-page controller, keyboard shortcuts, and a full options page for customization.

## Features

*   **Universal Control:** Works on almost any website with a standard HTML5 video player.
*   **On-Page HUD:** An intuitive, auto-hiding controller appears directly on the page. No need to open a popup!
*   **Draggable HUD:** Move the controller to wherever you like on the screen. The position is saved per-site.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Control speed, reset, and skip/replay without taking your hands off the keyboard.
*   **Full Customization via Options Page:**
    *   Set per-site default speeds (e.g., always 1.5x on YouTube).
    *   Manage a site exclusion list to disable the extension where you don't need it.
    *   Customize the speed step and skip/replay time amounts.
*   **Accessible & Ready for Translation:** Built with accessibility (ARIA labels) and internationalization (i18n) from the start.
